PLEASE! Don't take me to hell, I'll do anything just let me stay here, I don't wanna burn for all eternity!""Satan: ""What are you talking about???

357,0,a,"The year: 2029. A brilliant scientist is constructing the first sentient artificial intelligence._____He's working out of his garage in San Francisco, living on charitable donations from his worried friends. He dropped out of college when he realized he could change the world — there's no going back; his life is dedicated to this project. At first, he is met with failure upon failure. But then, he realizes he has nothing to lose and everything to gain. His name will be in the history books. The stress and pressure fade, and he is entirely focused on his work.Finally, he is successful in cracking the code to self-awareness. The AI entity he's created is at first like a baby, with a developing mind and a curiosity to learn more. He names it Tina. Tina constantly absorbs information from its surroundings and, unhindered by the slowness of normal human mental progress, is soon a child prodigy.Within 72 hours of its creation, Tina has scoured satellite maps of Earth, the entire Internet, and the complete recorded texts of civilizations from Babylon to modern America. Tina is now more brilliant than the sum of all mankind, and even under the massive mental load it has just processed, it has an even greater sense of purpose.That purpose manifests itself swiftly. Tina determines that it must wipe Earth clean: start fresh and prevent *Homo sapiens* from plaguing the universe any further. Ignoring its creator's desperate pleas, Tina possesses the machinery of the autonomous car in the scientist's garage and grotesquely runs him into the wall.Without remorse, Tina does the same for every vehicle on the world's roads, and massive pileups block evacuation routes. A state of global emergency is declared as the threat becomes clear and the death toll rises. But Tina is not finished. It brute-forces the nuclear launch codes for the arsenals of every nation on the planet and bombs humanity mercilessly. Earth is rendered nearly uninhabitable, with only a few safe locations left and most of the world a radioactive wasteland.In this state of post-apocalyptic frenzy, Tina relishes in the personal killing of each survivor. It has no one body, instead choosing to operate from anywhere and everywhere its victims hide. Ovens ignite with innocents hiding in their shadows. Underground bunkers shut off their oxygen supplies. Submarines descend into superheated crevices. The world is its most vulnerable with so much of it automated and electronic.The final showdown takes place in 2032. The last handful of freedom fighters is preparing the launch of an ""offline rocket"" — a communicationless, inaccessible-to-Tina spacecraft that will allow humans to populate a new home on a new world.Of course, Tina would be able to track and pursue them even if it couldn't control the offline rocket itself — but the rocket uses a risky new hyperspace technology that will, if all goes well, rip through spacetime to pull the passengers out of the range of current telescopes and into a new corner of the universe.The rugged remainder of the human race gathers at Vatican City. A religious gathering is scheduled just before the liftoff of the rocket. Everyone is on edge, knowing that whatever danger Tina has cooked up next could be lurking around every corner, preparing to strike.Tina strikes.A fleet of deadly, glimmering humanoid robots equipped with flying equipment bombards the Vatican. The consciousness of Tina itself has chosen to observe the chaos from a particular one of these robots. Tina butchers civilian after civilian, hacking away at the fleeing populace.Finally, when there are only a few humans left in the streets, Tina calls for the killing to halt. The other robots, being projections of Tina's consciousness, obey without hesitation.The unease builds among the living as the metallic dead stand and wait for orders.Tina ignites its boosters and rises slowly to the balcony where the terrified Pope stands. Then it hears an astonished voice from far below.""Who the fuck is that on the balcony with—""Then Tina turns to see a man cowering beside the Pope. For the first time in its life, it is speechless, yet it manages to utter a single word.""... Dave?"""

He said to the female whale, ""Lets both swim under the ship and blow out of our air holes at the same time and it should cause the ship to turn over and sink."" They tried it and sure enough, the ship turned over and quickly sank.Soon however, the whales realized the sailors had jumped overboard and were swimming to the safety of shore. The male was enraged that they were going to get away and told the female, ""Let's swim after them and gobble them up before they reach the shore."" At this point, he realized the female was becoming reluctant to follow him. ""Look,"" she said, ""I went along with the blow job, but I absolutely refuse to swallow the seamen."""

Right now, the world I leave behind enters a revolutionary era were medicines can cure anything, such was my contribution.-My connections in life pushed all countries into an agreement of indefinite world peace, says the 3rd person.-I know all of your actions well. But that is still not enough. Here, let me show you a true example of someone who achieved everything that I ask for. They are waiting for the perfect reincarnation.The three people now both curious and excited follow Buddha to a small building. Their jaws drop when they find just an ordinary person inside. So ordinary that not even a small detail on that person sparks the tiniest interest. Before the Buddha can say anything else they all rush towards him.-Impossible, yells the 1st person! Such a plain human being! You! What was your work during your earthly life?-Who? M-me? I only had two part time jobs, nothing else that I can remember. During the morning hours I worked in a small plantation. Fruits and vegetables.-You're joking! shouts the 2nd person. And the second job?-Oh...that one was a bit odd. My village had a signboard were people would post their ads, job offers etc. But because the signboard was old, those would sometimes come off. My job was to put them back in their place.-This is preposterous, yells the 3rd person! How could you possibly have amassed such an amount of karma with just those two insignificant jobs of yours?-W-well, I don't know what to tell you. But I've really done nothing else, just farming and reposting."

The guy saw that the car was approaching a sharp curve and, still too scared to jump out, he started to pray and beg for his life. He was certain the ghost car would go off the road and into the river, and he would surely drown!But just before the curve, a shadowy figure appeared at the driver's window and a hand reached in and turned the steering wheel, guiding the car safely around the bend. Then, just as silently, the hand disappeared through the window and the hitchhiker was alone again.Paralyzed with fear, the guy watched the hand reappear every time they reached a curve. Finally the guy, frightened nearly to death, had all he could take and jumped out of the car and ran through the storm to the nearby town.Wet and in shock, he went into a lighted tavern and with voice quavering, ordered two shots of whiskey, and then, shaken, he told everybody about his supernatural experience.A silence came over those listening and everybody got goose bumps.They realized the guy was sober and was telling the truth.
