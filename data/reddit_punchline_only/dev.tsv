Eventually the construction crew, all of them “gems-in-the-rough” more or less, had adopted her as a kind of project mascot.They chatted with her, let her sit with them while they had coffee and lunch breaks, and gave her little jobs to do here and there to make her feel important. At the end of the first week, they even presented her with a pay envelope containing ten dollars.The little girl took this home to her mother who suggested that she take her ten dollars “pay” she’d received to the bank the next day to start a savings account. When the girl and her mom got to the bank, the teller was equally impressed and asked the little girl how she had come by her very own pay check at such a young age.The little girl proudly replied: “I worked last week with a real construction crew building the new house next door to us.”“Oh my goodness gracious,” said the teller, “and will you be working on the house again this week, too?”The little girl replied, “I will if those lazy assholes from Lowe’s ever deliver the goddamn drywall.” "

PLEASE! Don't take me to hell, I'll do anything just let me stay here, I don't wanna burn for all eternity!""Satan: ""What are you talking about???

276,1,a,"So, after talking to it for awhile, the horse decides that it wants to learn how to play guitar. So the farmer does the only logical thing, and buys the horse a guitar. Somehow, the horse learns how to play the guitar, and tours the country on talk shows, concerts, and even meeting the president. The farmer becomes rich, but still prefers the quiet of his farm, so he returns back to the farm. The horse still goes all over, now that he's been hired as a live musician for several talk shows, but he returns to the farm every so often to check in with the farmer and the farm animals. After a few months, the farmer discovers that a chicken can speak as well, and has a burning desire to play the drums. Despite the obvious punchline, the farmer buys a specialty set of drums for the chicken. The chicken forms a two animal band with the horse, and they tour the country, produce a few CD's, and make the farmer even more money. Soon, more animals, a donkey and a sheep join the band as the singer and the bassist. The chicken, sheep, and donkey are going to their next concert, but the horse flies back to the farm to find the farmer, sadly, dead in his bed. Never having experienced such deep sadness, the horse does what his human companions taught him: he goes to the bar, where he sees a newspaper that says the flight the sheep, donkey, and chicken crashed into the mountains, and none survived. The horse walks up to the bar, tears flowing from his eyes. The bartender looks up at the horse, and says ""Why the long face?"""

Never getting a drivers license, to their first drink at 21, or even having sex.So they all decided they would go to their priest and ask if they can have 1 day off from being a nun. As this is a weird request the priest says “Yes, only if each one of you do something bad.”They all agree and off their separate ways. When the first nun comes back the priest asks her about her day. And she tells him all about how amazing it was driving around in a Ferrari. Stumped upon how she was driving a Ferrari he asks the nun how she was able to drive a Ferrari. She responds “You told me to do something bad. So I robbed a bank and bought a Ferrari.”In shock the priest told her to go drink some holy water to cleanse herself. And just as he starting to catch his breathe the second nun comes back. And she instantly starts telling him how great her day at the beach was wearing a bikini. And the priest feeling responsible now asks how she got the bikini. She responds ”I had to drown a lady to get it.”The priest baffled by what he just heard again tells her to drink the holy water to cleanse herself of the horrific crime she committed. The last nun walks in and tells the priest she had a great day just walking around the park. And he knew he had to ask. “Did you do anything bad?” She responds calmly “No, not really, I just peed in the holy water before I left.”"

The reporter ate it and said “Now, I can die.”The BBC Reporter said, ""I’m a reporter to the end. I want to take out my tape recorder and describe the scene here and what’s about to happen. Maybe someday someone will hear it and know that I was on the job till the end.”The ISIS leader directed an aide to hand over the tape recorder and dictated some comments. The reporter then said, ""Now I can die knowing I stayed true until the end.”The ISIS leader turned to the Israeli commando and said, “And now, Mr. Israeli tough guy, what is your final wish?”“Kick me in the butt ,” said the soldier.“What?"" asked the leader, “Will you mock us in your last hour?”“No, I’m not kidding. I want you to kick me in the butt ,” insisted the Israeli.So the terrorist leader shoved him into the open and kicked him in the behind. The soldier went sprawling, but rolled to his knees, pulled a 9 mm pistol from under his flak jacket, and shot the leader dead. In the resulting confusion, he jumped to his knapsack, pulled out his carbine and sprayed the terrorists with gunfire. In a flash, all terrorists were either dead or fleeing for their lives. As the soldier was untying the reporters, they asked him, “Why didn’t you just shoot them in the beginning? Why did you ask them to kick you in the butt first?”“What?” replied the Israeli, “and have you report that I was the aggressor?"

357,0,a,"He's working out of his garage in San Francisco, living on charitable donations from his worried friends. He dropped out of college when he realized he could change the world — there's no going back; his life is dedicated to this project. At first, he is met with failure upon failure. But then, he realizes he has nothing to lose and everything to gain. His name will be in the history books. The stress and pressure fade, and he is entirely focused on his work.Finally, he is successful in cracking the code to self-awareness. The AI entity he's created is at first like a baby, with a developing mind and a curiosity to learn more. He names it Tina. Tina constantly absorbs information from its surroundings and, unhindered by the slowness of normal human mental progress, is soon a child prodigy.Within 72 hours of its creation, Tina has scoured satellite maps of Earth, the entire Internet, and the complete recorded texts of civilizations from Babylon to modern America. Tina is now more brilliant than the sum of all mankind, and even under the massive mental load it has just processed, it has an even greater sense of purpose.That purpose manifests itself swiftly. Tina determines that it must wipe Earth clean: start fresh and prevent *Homo sapiens* from plaguing the universe any further. Ignoring its creator's desperate pleas, Tina possesses the machinery of the autonomous car in the scientist's garage and grotesquely runs him into the wall.Without remorse, Tina does the same for every vehicle on the world's roads, and massive pileups block evacuation routes. A state of global emergency is declared as the threat becomes clear and the death toll rises. But Tina is not finished. It brute-forces the nuclear launch codes for the arsenals of every nation on the planet and bombs humanity mercilessly. Earth is rendered nearly uninhabitable, with only a few safe locations left and most of the world a radioactive wasteland.In this state of post-apocalyptic frenzy, Tina relishes in the personal killing of each survivor. It has no one body, instead choosing to operate from anywhere and everywhere its victims hide. Ovens ignite with innocents hiding in their shadows. Underground bunkers shut off their oxygen supplies. Submarines descend into superheated crevices. The world is its most vulnerable with so much of it automated and electronic.The final showdown takes place in 2032. The last handful of freedom fighters is preparing the launch of an ""offline rocket"" — a communicationless, inaccessible-to-Tina spacecraft that will allow humans to populate a new home on a new world.Of course, Tina would be able to track and pursue them even if it couldn't control the offline rocket itself — but the rocket uses a risky new hyperspace technology that will, if all goes well, rip through spacetime to pull the passengers out of the range of current telescopes and into a new corner of the universe.The rugged remainder of the human race gathers at Vatican City. A religious gathering is scheduled just before the liftoff of the rocket. Everyone is on edge, knowing that whatever danger Tina has cooked up next could be lurking around every corner, preparing to strike.Tina strikes.A fleet of deadly, glimmering humanoid robots equipped with flying equipment bombards the Vatican. The consciousness of Tina itself has chosen to observe the chaos from a particular one of these robots. Tina butchers civilian after civilian, hacking away at the fleeing populace.Finally, when there are only a few humans left in the streets, Tina calls for the killing to halt. The other robots, being projections of Tina's consciousness, obey without hesitation.The unease builds among the living as the metallic dead stand and wait for orders.Tina ignites its boosters and rises slowly to the balcony where the terrified Pope stands. Then it hears an astonished voice from far below.""Who the fuck is that on the balcony with—""Then Tina turns to see a man cowering beside the Pope. For the first time in its life, it is speechless, yet it manages to utter a single word.""... Dave?"""

The male whale recognized it as the same ship that had harpooned his father many years earlier. He said to the female whale, ""Lets both swim under the ship and blow out of our air holes at the same time and it should cause the ship to turn over and sink."" They tried it and sure enough, the ship turned over and quickly sank.Soon however, the whales realized the sailors had jumped overboard and were swimming to the safety of shore. The male was enraged that they were going to get away and told the female, ""Let's swim after them and gobble them up before they reach the shore."" At this point, he realized the female was becoming reluctant to follow him. ""Look,"" she said, ""I went along with the blow job, but I absolutely refuse to swallow the seamen."""

Just beyond the man and the fire there are three small grass huts. The captain orders the ship to get as close as it can to the island, and then sends out a small rescue boat. The boat returns with the exhausted man who is gleefully shouting ""thank you Lord for rescuing me!"" The captain asks the man "" how long have you've been stranded on this island?"" The man replies ""oh, for several years, and I've prayed every day to be rescued."" The captain then asks ""how many of you were on the island?"" The man replies ""just me sir"" the captain then says ""well I'm confused, I can clearly see three small grass huts, and it's only you? Why build three huts?"" The man replies "" well that first hut, that's my home, it's where I've lived these last several years. That second hut, well that's my church. I go there every Sunday and pray to be rescued.""

Right after he picked her up, he felt the need to fart, but he figured he could wait until they got to the movies.When they got there, he asked her if she wanted some popcorn and Coke. She said sure, so he went to the restroom. The line was long, so he went back to the lobby, got the food, and went back into the theatre.When the movie was over, he goes to the bathroom again, still with a tremondously long line. So he figures he can wait until he drops her off.When they pull up into her driveway, she exclaims, ''Oh goodie. My grandparents are here. Come on in and meet them.''He agrees, although his A-hole is about to cry at this point.They go in and sit down at the table. Finally, he couldn't hold it in any longer a tried to let it seep out a little at a time. As he squeezed out a toxic blast, he aimed it towards the family's hound dog Duke, in hopes that they might blame the pooch for the horrendous fart. The girl's father stands up and hollers ''Duke!!'' and sits back down.''Great!'' he thought. ''They really think it's the dog!'' So, he starts bombarding the room with a couple, more powerful, louder stinkers.Once again, the girl's father stands up, shouts ''Duke!!'' and sits back down.Finally, he lets it all go and the loudest most hair-curling fart you've ever heard or smelt rippled through the dining room. The girl's father stands up again. ''Duke, get the hell out from under him before he shits on you!!''"
